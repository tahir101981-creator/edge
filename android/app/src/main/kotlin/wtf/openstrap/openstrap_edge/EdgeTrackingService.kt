/**
 * Foreground service that keeps the app process alive while backgrounded so the live
 * flutter_blue_plus connection keeps draining the strap. Silent, low-priority, ongoing
 * notification titled "Edge Tracking".
 *
 * STICKY: the service asks the OS to recreate it after a memory-pressure kill
 * (START_STICKY). Recreating the service restarts the process, which re-runs
 * EdgeApplication.ensureEngine() → creates the long-lived FlutterEngine on first
 * need → Dart main() detects the
 * headless launch and auto-connects to the paired band (see headless_boot.dart) —
 * so one OS kill no longer means "no sync until the app is reopened". A periodic
 * WorkManager watchdog (KeepAliveWorker) backs this up for the cases START_STICKY
 * doesn't cover (user-swiped task on some OEMs, delayed restarts).

         * going through Dart — CompanionBridge.onDeviceAppeared (fires whenever
         * the band re-enters BLE range, which happens routinely mid-run from
         * arm-swing/body-block dropouts), KeepAliveWorker and BootReceiver.
         * They use [start] below, whose Intent carries no EXTRA_LOCATION, so
         * onStartCommand used to read `false` and re-call startForeground()
         * with CONNECTED_DEVICE only — silently STRIPPING the location type off
         * a live workout. On Android 14+ that ends location delivery the next
         * time the app is backgrounded and the route just stops mid-ride, with
         * no crash and no log.
         *
         * So the extra is now tri-state: present ⇒ authoritative (and latched
         * here), absent ⇒ inherit whatever the live session last asked for.
         * A process kill resets this to false, which is correct — Dart re-arms
         * it via EdgeTracking.start(location: true) when it rehydrates the
         * orphaned workout.
