// DAY STEPS — when the day's steps were counted, and by what.
//
// The day total on Home is a sum of SPANS: each stretch of the day goes to the
// sensor that was actually recording it, overlaps are counted once, and the
// rest of the day is not counted at all. That resolution has never been
// visible anywhere — the tile can say "Strap + phone" in two words and stops
// there. This is the screen that shows the stretches.
//
// WHY THE SOURCE IS THE POINT, and not a footnote on it. The two counters are
// not two readings of one quantity. Measured against camera-annotated free
// living (docs/internal/OXWALK_VALIDATION.md), a wrist reads a real walk about
// a quarter low and can read rhythmic hand work as walking — its error runs
// both ways and has no ceiling above. The same class of counter carried at the
// trunk barely over-counts at all. So a strap-counted hour and a phone-counted
// hour are different kinds of number, and the one place a user could ever learn
// that is here, beside the spans themselves.
//
// It is ONE line, in the frame's footnote, phrased for whichever sensors
// actually counted this day — not a warning per span, not a percentage beside
// every number, not a modal. No numbers from that study appear on screen: a
// "33% error" printed against today's count would be read as a correction the
// user could apply, and it is not one (the error changes sign with the
// activity, which is exactly why no gain fixes it).
//
// What this screen deliberately does NOT do: no goal, no target, no comparison
// with yesterday, no streak. It answers one question — where did today's steps
// come from — and the trend lives one screen up.
