// A rough night, and the one question the app cannot answer for itself.
//
// READ THE REFUSAL THIS WORKS INSIDE before changing anything here. It is
// written at the top of `analytics human/event_detection.dart` and it has three
// parts: the nocturnal signature is not specific (alcohol, a late meal, early
// illness, the luteal phase and a hot bedroom all look alike); there are no
// labels to train on; and a wrong "looks like a drinking night" is an
// accusation on a phone somebody else can see.
//
// The first two are answered by asking instead of guessing. The third is not,
// and a question that names alcohol is still the app raising alcohol. So the
// screen is split in half:
//
//   · THE STATE is a measurement and ships like any other. It says the night
//     was harder than this person's own nights and names WHICH measurements
//     moved. No cause, no score, no probability.
//   · THE ATTRIBUTION is opt-in, once, by a tap that names nothing. Until then
//     no tag vocabulary is rendered at all — and "alcohol" lives in that
//     vocabulary, so nobody meets it unasked.
//
// `alcoholNightFlag` IS NOT CALLED and must not be. What is called is
// [ana.roughNight], the one function that file says may ship — for its
// descriptor and nothing else. The four signs it counts are counted here from
// the four published nightly series, MDC-gated exactly the way the classifier
// gates them, because `roughNight` is a function of the sign COUNT and nothing
// else in `EventState` reaches this file.
//
// `NightSignature` is not used either. It may only exist as a REPLACEMENT for
// `multivariateAnomaly`, and that detector is live in the crossday rollup.
//
// One card per night, always: when this fires it REPLACES the "Sleeping heart
// rate ran high" card in `sleep_detail._unusual` rather than stacking on it.
// Two cards about one night are two observations as far as the reader can tell.
