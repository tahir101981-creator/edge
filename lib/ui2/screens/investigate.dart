// NERD STATS — density 3 of 3. (File and classes keep the old `Investigate`
// name on purpose: renaming them churns every import, the gallery keys and
// twelve golden files for zero user benefit. The user-facing string is the
// only thing that was ever "Investigate".)
//
// THE NUMBERS BEHIND THE PICTURE. The visual screens — Beats above all — are
// where the RR-derived family is now shown; this is the companion that prints
// what those pictures were drawn from: the figures, the beat counts, the
// coverage, the abstention notes, the algorithm version, in fixed pitch, with
// the method and its citation underneath. It is no longer where the good
// stuff hides. It is where you check the good stuff's arithmetic.
//
// Nothing here is styled to reassure: a number that is absent is absent, a
// number that is relative says so on its own row, and an estimator that
// abstained gets to state its own reason VERBATIM — a raw diagnostic string
// belongs on exactly this surface and nowhere else.
//
// There is no "advanced mode" toggle anywhere in this app and this screen is
// not gated by one. Density 3 here means "one tap from the picture", not
// "locked" — Beats, Vitals, Sleep, Readiness and every metric drill-down each
// carry a plain row down to it.

  // ── RESP-01 · the 30-night screen ───────────────────────────────────────────
  //
  // THE COPY IS THE PRODUCT and it was written before this widget existed. It
  // has to survive an adversarial reader trying to get a diagnosis out of it, so
  // four things are structural rather than editorial:
  //
  //   * NO CONDITION IS NAMED. Not in the headline, not in the body, not as a
  //     hedge ("this is not X" still teaches the reader that X is the subject).
  //     The card names the pattern it counted and what a clinician does.
  //   * NO NUMBER. No index, no rate, no severity, no per-night value, no count
  //     of anything that could be read as events. `nights_used` is provenance —
  //     how much of the user's own record is behind the sentence — and it is the
  //     only figure allowed.
  //   * IT MAY NOT REASSURE. The refusal to clear anything is a paragraph in the
  //     body, present in BOTH states, and never a footnote or a tooltip. An
  //     absent flag is not a negative result: this screen is blunted by
  //     beta-blockers, autonomic neuropathy and diabetes and misses real cases.
  //   * IT TERMINATES IN A CLINICIAN, never in a number and never in an action
  //     the app can take.
  //
  // It sits BELOW the per-night table on purpose. The table is one night's raw
  // counts, which is what the whole aggregate exists to stop anyone reading as a
  // finding — so the card that says "across nights, never on one" has to come
  // after the night it is talking about, not before it.
  //
  // And it lives on Nerd stats, density 3, reached by walking here. On the
  // Sleep screen the same words become a headline, and a headline is how a
  // screen that fires on atrial fibrillation, on altitude and on any broken-up
  // night turns into a diagnosis in somebody's head.
