// WHAT CHANGED — the nightly sweep, given a screen.
//
// The sweep already existed and already worked: `nightly_sweep.dart` measures
// each metric against THIS person's own trailing history, cuts the window at
// the most recent algorithm break so a release of ours is never reported as a
// finding about them, needs a fortnight before it will judge anything, and
// stays quiet when there is nothing to say. Its entire delivery was a push
// notification body. Dismiss the notification and the finding was gone — no
// list, no history, no way to ask "what did it say last Tuesday".
//
// So this screen adds no analysis. It calls the same two functions the evening
// briefing calls, on a day you can steer, and prints what they return.
//
// NOTHING IS THE COMMON ANSWER AND IT IS A COMPLETE ONE. `kNothingStoodOut` is
// a first-class outcome and is not padded out with the day's numbers to look
// like more — the numbers are three taps away on screens built for them, and
// restating them here would turn "nothing was unusual" into a wall of text
// that reads as though something was.
//
// NO VERDICT COLOUR. A finding is a direction and a distance, never a good or
// a bad: a high strain day and a high resting heart rate are the same
// arithmetic and only one of them is bad news, and the screen has no way to
// know which. Arrows say which way; nothing says whether.
