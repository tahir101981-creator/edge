// DAY TIMELINE — what happened, in the order it happened.
//
// Every screen in this app answers "how much" for one number over many days.
// None of them answered "what was going on around then", which is the question
// somebody asks the moment a line moves: the workout, the nap, the coffee at
// nine, the night the band spent on the charger. The pieces were all on disk
// and all on the same axis already — `getDayTimeline` joins HR, HRV, sleep,
// naps, sessions and events; `getDayWear` holds the off-wrist segments; meals,
// doses and timed journal fields each carry their own clock — and nothing put
// them in one column.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. It is not an explanation. Two things next to each other on a
// clock is adjacency, and adjacency is not cause — a timeline is the most
// tempting place in the app to imply otherwise, so the page states the limit
// in the same words the journal findings use and never orders items by
// anything but time.
//
// A THING WITH NO CLOCK DOES NOT GET A PLACE ON ONE. A journal note is stored
// per DAY with no time, and so is a meal logged without one. Placing those
// anywhere on the axis — midnight, noon, the middle — would be inventing the
// one fact the entry is missing. They go in their own block underneath, which
// says what it is.
