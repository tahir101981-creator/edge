// THE MONTH AS THREE STRIPS — sleep, recovery, strain, one cell per day.
//
// A shade is not a score. Every cell is the day's place in THIS PERSON'S OWN
// range — the 10th to 90th percentile of every day they have stored for that
// metric — and nothing here is compared to a population, a target, or anybody
// else. A darker strain cell is a bigger day, not a better one; a darker sleep
// cell is a longer night, not a healthier one. The footnote says so, because a
// grid is the surface a reader is most likely to read a verdict into.
//
// ABSENCE IS AN OUTLINE, and that rule was already solved: `HeatMap` draws a
// null as a stroked cell rather than a faint fill, because a faint fill and a
// genuinely low value measured 1.00:1 against each other. A day the band was
// off must never look like a bad day.
//
// A METRIC WITH NO RANGE IS NOT SHADED AT ALL. Placing a day inside a
// distribution built from nine other days is a shade with nothing behind it, so
// a metric under [kGridMinHistory] days is left out of the picture entirely and
// says why in words. It does not get a paler version of the same claim.
//
// AND THERE IS NO STREAK IN HERE. A month grid is the classic place one gets
// in — a run of filled cells is exactly the shape a streak wants to be — so
// the only count on the page is "N of 30 days", which cannot reset to zero and
// does not pay more for consecutive days than for scattered ones.
