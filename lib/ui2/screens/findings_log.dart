// OBSERVATIONS — the log of every health watch that has ever fired.
//
// Named for the card it is a history of: the Observation widget has printed
// "HEALTH OBSERVATION" over the illness card since the design system existed,
// and these six detectors are what that card is. Deliberately NOT "what
// changed", which is the nightly sweep's screen and a different question — the
// sweep measures every metric against your own trailing history, while these
// are standing watches with their own thresholds.
//
// Four detectors fire on every rollup and exactly one of them, illness, ever
// reached a screen. The other three — the overnight anomaly, the skin
// temperature flag, and the change-point search that says "your resting
// heart-rate trend shifted" — existed only as a push notification. One buzz,
// and dismissing it lost it for good.
//
// A LOG YOU GO TO, NOT A FEED THAT COMES TO YOU. notification_center.dart
// records that the in-app notifications feed was removed deliberately, because
// it duplicated the OS notification with no independent value, and Home bans
// observation cards. Both of those hold here: nothing on this screen is
// unread-marked, nothing badges a tab, nothing is dismissible, and the only
// way to it is a section on Health that you chose to open. It is a place to
// look something up, not a second place to be interrupted from.
//
// It is also DETECTION, NEVER DIAGNOSIS, all the way down. Every sentence is
// the detector's own, written once in findings.dart, and the medical-class
// entries carry the same "this is a screen, see a clinician" wording they
// carry in the notification.
