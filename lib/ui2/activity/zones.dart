// HEART-RATE ZONES — the ceiling, the two anchors, and (only sometimes) the
// 28-day distribution. TS-03 / TS-04 / TS-05.
//
// THE SENTENCE IS THE FEATURE. Zone edges are percentages of a ceiling, and
// this app has two completely different ceilings depending on what it has seen:
// a number MEASURED on the wrist, or `208 − 0.7·age`. Those are materially
// different claims and the screen says which one it is every time. The number
// itself never changes its wording either: "highest we've seen" with the date
// and the session, never "your max HR", and nothing anywhere invites a
// max-effort test.
//
// WHY THE DISTRIBUTION IS OFTEN ABSENT. A three-bar "most of your minutes are
// in the grey middle" read off bands built on 220−age is manufactured — the
// bars would be a picture of an arithmetic assumption, not of training. So it
// is GATED, in the repository, not captioned: no observed ceiling and no
// measured resting HR means no chart at all. It appears about four weeks after
// the band first sees you go hard, and not before.
//
// WHAT THIS SCREEN WILL BE ACCUSED OF. A very low resting heart rate makes
// zone 1 enormous — 48 → 184 bpm puts Z1 at 48–116. That is the reserve
// arithmetic working exactly as intended and it will be reported as a bug, so
// the copy names it before the user does.
