// The activity vocabulary — ~70 things a person actually does, in eight
// groups, each carrying a published MET value except the one row that names
// no activity at all.
//
// Why MET and not a made-up "intensity": a calorie figure has to come from
// somewhere, and "somewhere" is Ainsworth et al., Compendium of Physical
// Activities (2011 update, Med Sci Sports Exerc 43(8):1575-81). The arithmetic
// is one line — kcal = MET × 3.5 × kg / 200 × minutes — and it needs body
// weight, which the app may not have. So [Activity.kcal] returns null rather
// than a number, and the screens say so. A fabricated calorie count is worse
// than no calorie count, because it looks the same as a measured one.
//
// The app's stored workout vocabulary is the free-form `sessions.type` TEXT
// column, so this table needs no schema of its own: [byName] maps a stored
// type back to its entry, and an unknown type simply falls through to null.
