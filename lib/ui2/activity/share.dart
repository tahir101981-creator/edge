// Share — one card, one photo slot, one button.
//
// This screen used to ask three questions: which of three styles, which four
// of nine stats, and whether to add a photo. Two of them were the screen
// asking the user to do its job. The style list offered a textured card whose
// texture a lift and a flow session could not have; the chip row asked which
// of your own measurements to leave off a card with room for all of them.
//
// What is left is the one question only the user can answer — is there a
// picture of this — and the card rearranges itself around the answer:
//
//   · no photo  → the basemap IS the card, whole, start to stop
//   · a photo   → the photograph is the card, and the route dissolves into
//                 its bottom-right corner with no frame of its own
//
// Nothing on the card is invented. If a session has no distance, "Distance"
// is not printed, so it cannot be shared.
