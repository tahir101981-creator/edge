// The heart rate arriving RIGHT NOW.
//
// Live HR is not a workout-only quantity, but the stream is not free either:
// the screen hosting this card owns the realtime-HR stream while it is mounted
// (`AppState.retainLiveHrView` / `releaseLiveHrView`, discussion #287), so a
// beat is a second old while someone is looking at it and the band goes quiet
// again when they leave. It was simply never surfaced outside the workout
// screen.
//
// THE RULES THIS FILE HOLDS:
//
//   · It OWNS NO TIME. The first version ran a `Timer.periodic` and a heart
//     that pulsed at the measured rate off a repeating controller — which the
//     design-system tests correctly rejected: an endless loop cannot be stopped
//     by the reduced-motion gate, and raw `Duration`s bypass `motion()`. The
//     deeper problem was architectural: the trace also died every time the
//     screen closed. The buffer lives on [AppState] now and this is a pure
//     renderer.
//   · The trace is READINGS, not seconds, and says so. Samples arrive when the
//     band delivers them, so calling it "the last 90 seconds" would be a claim
//     about spacing nothing here guarantees.
//   · Absence states its reason and never a number. `AppState.liveHr` returns
//     null past [AppState.liveHrMaxAge], so an unworn band, a dropped link and
//     a backgrounded HR-only downgrade all arrive as null — and each gets the
//     sentence that is true for it.
//   · It repaints ALONE. A 1 Hz stream hung off a `watch` in a parent would
//     rebuild that whole tree once a second for the life of the connection.
