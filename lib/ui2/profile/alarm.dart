// The band alarm.
//
// This screen exists because the alarm is the one thing in the app that keeps
// working when the app does not. It is armed on the STRAP's own real-time
// clock, so it survives the app being killed, the phone rebooting, and the
// phone being out of range entirely. The rebuild shipped with no alarm UI at
// all while `AppState` still restored `alarm_epoch` on launch and still ran the
// confirmation state machine — which means an alarm armed on an older build
// went on firing every morning with nothing anywhere to see it or stop it.
//
// The honesty problem is confirmation. Writing SET_ALARM to the band is not
// evidence that the band latched it; the strap says so separately, by emitting
// event 56, and it might never arrive. And after a relaunch there is no live
// confirmation at all — only the epoch we wrote down. Three different states,
// and the screen says which one it is rather than drawing a confident green
// tick over all three.
//
// A single next-occurrence time picker used to live here. It is gone: the
// weekly schedule below is now the ONLY thing that arms the band (AppState
// computes the next enabled occurrence on every connect/sync), so a second,
// independent "set one alarm" affordance would just be a second source of
// truth that the schedule engine silently overwrites on the next sync.
