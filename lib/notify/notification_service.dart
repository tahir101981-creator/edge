// notification_service.dart — the ONE place OS-level notifications are presented.
//
// It is source-agnostic: device alerts (battery/charging), derive-driven insights
// (illness, recovery), and scheduled nudges (wind-down, weekly recap, move) all
// flow through here. NotificationCenter decides *whether* to fire; this class is
// purely the OS presentation + scheduling layer.
//
// Design guarantees:
//   • Two gates, two rules. NotificationPrefs.shouldFireOs decides what may be
//     PRESENTED, and holds the three-class rule there. [schedulableIds] decides
//     what may be SCHEDULED — the OS fires a zonedSchedule with no Dart
//     running, so the presentation gate never sees one, and a scheduled slot is
//     allowed on a different test: the user asked for it by name, at a time or
//     interval they picked, and it has something to say when it fires.
//   • One channel per category (NotifCategory) so Android users mute each kind
//     independently. The `health` channel is max-importance (illness alerts).
//   • Notification ids are partitioned by NotificationEvent.osId; fixed device +
//     scheduled-reminder ids live in disjoint low bands (< 3000).
//   • One init, one permission prompt.
//   • Local + scheduled only — NO FCM/APNs (this app is cloud-free by design).
//     `kServerIdBase` stays reserved-but-unused for any future push layer.
//
// Tap routing: a tapped notification's payload (a deep-link route) is pushed onto
// [taps]; AppState listens and navigates.
